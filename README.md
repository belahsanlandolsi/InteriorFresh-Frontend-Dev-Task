This solution implements exactly the requested features: a 3-step flow with Tailwind styling, 4 room cards, and a Submit that only logs to the console.

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

## Test
1) Step 1: type Project name + Description → Continue  
2) Step 2: pick one of the 4 room cards → Continue  
3) Step 3: review Summary → Submit → open browser **Console** to see the payload

## Notes
- Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript (optional per brief)
- No backend / no API routes
- Clean components, responsive grid for cards
